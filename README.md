# XMEngine4

Proprietary game engine supporting multiplayer, simple bots, shaders, animations, physics and more.

This repo contains only source codes and no assets due to unknown rights. 
The engine depends on XMServer and backend master server, which is not part of this repo (lost sources).

I´ve wrote this engine in my early days of C/C++ programming, the sources contain insecurities, stack overflows unchecked bounds and other beginner mistakes. 
As I don´t intend to do any game-dev in rest of my life, I left the code unfixed as was in original.

May someone from another galaxy may find this code useful.
